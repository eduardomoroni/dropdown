## Task
Your task is to create a dropdown that will show a list of countries and to create a button.

A.C.
- It has a default option (placeholder), that says: "Select a Country"
- When clicking on the button, it will `window.alert` or `console.log`, whatever is selected on the dropdown.
- You have to source the country list from a file `countries.json` that is available on the boilerplate project.
- If the user hasn't selected a country, the button MUST be non-clickable (disabled).

Tips
Do not invest time on styling at this point, it is not part of the evaluation

Ground rules:
- You can decide writing this task in vanilla JS + CSS + HTML or React ([CRA boilerplate](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)), there is no "extra points" in doing in one or the other. We want to you use whatever makes you more comfortable. We will provide the boilerplate to save your time.
- You are no allowed to bring in any external dependency.
- If some A.C. is not clear enough, please ask questions. It's important to know that you fully understand what is required.
